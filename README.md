[00:16.24] You roam the city free
[00:24.96] With a bigger dream (yeah)
[00:37.96] 
[00:40.01] You keep on drifting through
[00:49.06] Seeking something new
[00:59.56] 
[00:57.28] I'm here
[00:58.26] You want what's brighter than the summer sky
[01:01.95] Whiter than moonlight on a winter's night
[01:06.23] Deeper than the deep sea
[01:08.24] So what if wishes came true for you?
[01:26.24] 
[01:13.10] Adam and Eve would toss the apple away
[01:17.58] The earth would turn the other way
[01:21.64] You'd live up far on some barren star
[01:25.79] But down below you might hear us laughing
[01:46.29] 
[01:29.83] I'll give you all you're wanting so bad
[01:33.68] Hold out your hands
[01:35.01] Whisper a prayer
[01:37.46] Can you feel forever and ever?
[01:52.46] 
[01:41.45] Rejoice, be glad
[01:49.56] Rejoice and be glad
[01:59.06] 
[01:56.32] Wanting to come down
[02:05.05] You're not finding ground
[02:17.55] 
[02:45.33] I'm here
[02:46.12] You want what's brighter than the summer sky
[02:50.04] Whiter than moonlight on a winter's night
[02:54.00] Deeper than the deep sea
[02:56.20] So what if wishes came true for you?
[03:14.20] 
[03:01.21] Adam and Eve would toss the apple away
[03:05.52] The earth would turn the other way
[03:09.73] You'd live up far on some barren star
[03:13.79] But down below you might hear us laughing
[03:34.29] 
[03:17.88] I'll give you all you're wanting so bad
[03:21.77] Hold out your hands
[03:23.25] Whisper a prayer
[03:25.40] Can you feel forever and ever?
[03:29.34] Can you feel forever, forever?
[03:44.34] 
[03:35.54] Rejoice, be glad
[03:43.27] Rejoice and be glad
[03:52.77] 
[03:53.49] (Rejoice, be glad)
[04:01.79] (Rejoice and be glad)
[04:12.29] 
[04:09.50] (Rejoice, be glad)
[04:17.79] (Rejoice and be glad)
